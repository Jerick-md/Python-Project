# Tkinter Calculator 🧮

A **simple GUI calculator** built using **Python Tkinter**.  
This application allows users to input mathematical expressions and evaluate them using a button click.

---

## 📌 Project Description

This project demonstrates:
- Basic **GUI development** using Tkinter
- Handling user input with Entry widgets
- Displaying results using Labels
- Button click events to evaluate expressions

It is ideal for **beginners learning Python GUI programming**.

---

## 🛠 Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (included by default with Python)

⚠️ Optional:
- `certificate.png` (used as the window icon)

## 🚀 How to Run the Program

1. Download or clone this repository
2. Make sure Python is installed
3. Open a terminal inside the project folder
4. Run the program:

```bash
python calculator.py
```

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. User types a mathematical expression (e.g. `5+10*2`) into the Entry box
2. Clicking the **=** button triggers the `onclick()` function
3. The expression is evaluated using `eval()`
4. The result is displayed on the screen

---

## ⚠️ Notes

- The program uses Python's `eval()` function  
  ⚠️ Do not use this approach for real-world applications without validation
- Designed for **learning and practice only**

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- Add calculator buttons (0–9, +, −, ×, ÷)
- Input validation
- Keyboard support
- Improved UI design
- Error handling for invalid expressions
